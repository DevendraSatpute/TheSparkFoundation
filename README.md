Predictive Analysis using Supervised Machine Learning.

This task given by The Sparak Foundation intership to perform predictive analysis using supervised machine Learning.
Here we perform predictive analysis on the basis of linear regression equation. first we trained the machine from the past input and output data and on the basis of this we calculate coefficient and intercept value of linear regression equation. After the calculation of coefficient value we predict the mark on the basis of given input no. of hours of study.
